# PRODIGY_MAY25_TaskNumber_1

## 🎯 Task Objective

Implement a **Linear Regression** model to predict the prices of houses based on the following features:

- Square Footage
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms

This is Task-01 for the **PRODIGY MAY25** track.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is from the Kaggle competition:  
[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

You will need to download the dataset manually from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., `data/`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## 📊 Model Description

A simple Linear Regression model is trained on selected features (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) to estimate house prices. The workflow includes:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance visualization

---

## 📈 Results

Evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R² score) are calculated to assess the performance of the linear regression model.
